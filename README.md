## Project Title: Electricity prices vs population

## Team Members

* Gabriel Pivaro

* Justin Chow

## Project Description/Outline


There has been a diversification of electricity sources in the past few decades. This has led to a rising and lowering cost in the electricity depending on the source diversification and, of course, the location within the United States. We are interested in determining whether the population density will add to the cost.

The analysis of this project is available at the [project notebook](./Project_Notebook.ipynb).

## Research Questions to answer 

* Is there any correlation between Electricity prices vs Population?

* Does the number of Power Plants correlate with the Electricity price?

* Does Electricity Generation correlate to Electricity price?

* Is Consumption related to Electricity prices?

* There are states where electricity is regulated. Does being regulated by local agencies matter?


## Data sets to be used

* US Census Data â€“ CSVs
* EIA (US Energy Information Admin) API
