This repository contains the following scenario:

## Project Title: Electricity prices vs population

## Team Members

* Gabriel Pivaro
* Jocelyn Flores
* Joshua Rhoads
* Justin Chow
* Kimberly Flores


## Project Description/Outline


There has been a diversification of electricity sources in the past few decades. This has led to a rising and lowering cost in the electricity depending on the source diversification and, of course, the location within the United States. We are interested in determining whether the population density will add to the cost.

The analysis of this project is available at the [project notebook](./Project_Notebook.ipynb).

## Research Questions to answer 

* Are there any correlations between Electricity prices vs population?

* Is Cost of Living related to the cost of electricity?

* (?) Does the number of power plants correlate the electricity price?

* Local taxes (?) 

* Are there are significant events that have affected electricity prices over the years


## Data sets to be used

* US Census Data â€“ CSVs?
* EIA (US Energy Information Admin) API
